             the right funny quote will make it a memorable gift for anyone who reads it 
             and laughs. Humorous quotes about life and work help us chuckle our way out 
             of stress and monotony.
            Funny quotes often have more than one meaning, too. Read between the 
            lines and find the perfect quote (and subtext) to make your next project
             more fun for you and everyone else.
